notes:

hello my is eric bowers and my partners name is danial zaliek

today, our project proposal will be on index finger imaging tracking

before i get in to the goal of the project who has heard of the leapmotion

next slide

basically the leap motion can track all ten of your finger to do multple thing are your computer

show video

show what the leapmotion looks like 

so reason why i showed you this leap motion is bc we are going to do a smaller version of motion 
by tracking only using the index finger 

to help us on this project we will you a kinect or web cam

after that we will create a algorthim that will track a index finger

and produces some sort of image after words

here is a rough idea how its supose to work

next slide

show orginal video

tell what the steps 

get go at the after video 

now my partner will give example that this can be done
